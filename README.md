# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C. Each folder contains code for a specific data structure, including Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, and Trees.

## Directory Structure

- **Linked-List/**: Contains implementations and examples of different types of linked lists (e.g., singly linked list, doubly linked list).
- **Queue/**: Contains implementations and examples of queue data structures (e.g., simple queue, circular queue).
- **Stack/**: Contains implementations and examples of stack data structures (e.g., array-based stack, linked list-based stack).
- **Trees/**: Contains implementations and examples of various tree data structures (e.g., binary tree, binary search tree).
